/**
 * In this file you are setting the constants that you'll be using for your redux. This is designed
 * for best practice (in my opinion). You will set the action types here as variables and call them
 * where you need to. Be sure to export the code as show below and delete the example. You will be
 * exporting them separately and within a default.
 *
 * HINTS:
 * - Both your reducer and actions will be using this file so make use of it
