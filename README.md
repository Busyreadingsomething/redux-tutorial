# Redux-Tutorial
A quick guide to get started with Redux

This is mean to be a quick guide for people who are new to Redux and want to learn how to refactor a current working React app to work with Redux. This repo is designed for people are comfortable with Redux and wants a challenge and really understand the nitty gritty by the end of the day.

Currently a basic application is being made, but once the React is completed, a solutions code will be designed along with test for people to pass in order to guide them.

Some future plans:
1. Add the solution code for Redux Refactor in a solutions branch
2. Implementing Redux Saga testing

---

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone it down

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

**Install Homebrew**

``` /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" ```

You'll be using this to install any major tech such as Node or Postgres. Real rangers use Homebrew~

**Install node via Homebrew**

``` brew install node```

This will add node and npm. Neat~

**This app runs on PORT 5000**

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

After forking and cloning to your local computer:

1. Install dependencies with ``` npm install```
2. Build the bundle with webpack ```npm run prod``` for production ```npm run dev``` for development
3. Start the server with ```npm start``` for production or ```npm run server``` for development


## Running the tests

To see if the tests are passing:
``` npm test ```

The tests utilize **JEST** and **ENZYME** with the intention of providing you the appropriate guidance to complete this repo.
